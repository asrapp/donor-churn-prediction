## Introduction
Donor churn significantly impacts fundraising efforts. Predicting churn enables organizations to implement targeted retention strategies.

## Objectives
- Predict which donors are likely to churn.
- Identify key factors influencing donor retention.
- Develop actionable insights to improve donor engagement.

## Data Acquisition
- **Datasets:**
  - Utilize publicly available datasets that mirror donor behaviors and fundraising activities.
  
- **Data Sources:**
  - Kaggle: [Fundraising Data]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ibrahimelsayed182/donation-analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michaelpawlus/fundraising-data?select=data_science_for_fundraising_donor_data.csv))
  
## Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Encode categorical variables.
- Normalize or standardize numerical features.
- Split data into training and testing sets.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze the distribution of variables.
- Identify correlations between features.
- Visualize data using plots and charts.

## Feature Engineering
- Create new features such as Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) scores.
- Develop engagement metrics like Email Opens and Event Participation.
- Calculate Donor Lifetime Value.

## Model Development
- Select appropriate algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- Train models using the training dataset.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## Model Evaluation
- Assess models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Use confusion matrices and ROC curves for detailed evaluation.
- Select the best-performing model based on evaluation results.

## Deployment
- Implement the model in a simulated environment.
- Develop a dashboard using Tableau to visualize predictions and insights.
- Document the deployment process and user guidelines.

## Conclusion
- Summarize findings and insights.
- Discuss the implications for donor retention strategies.
- Propose recommendations for future work.

## References
- List all data sources, tools, and literature referenced during the project.
